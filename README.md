< Alayne's Script Collection >

After several asks, here's a link to my github

Feel free to comment or add anything that might be usefull and that I won't think of

I've decided to release my scripts here, it'll be easier to me so I can duplicate it on hercules and rathena rather than uploading twice. So sorry for multiple upload between there and download section

Don't mind the name Nyliar in the git, that's me too ^^
